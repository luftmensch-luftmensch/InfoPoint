    container_name: infopoint-mongodb
   # By default, a Mongo database is running on the 27017 port.
   # If we want to access the database from our computer (outside the container),
   # we must share the port with our computer's port.
   # The syntax is [port we want on our machine]:[port we want to retrieve in the container]
   # Note: You are free to change your computer's port,
   # but take into consideration that it will change the way
   # you are connecting to your database.
