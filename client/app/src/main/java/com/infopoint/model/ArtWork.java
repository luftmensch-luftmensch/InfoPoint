        Data binding generates a class named BR (BindingResources) in the module package which contains the IDs of the resources used for data binding.
        The Bindable annotation generates an entry in the BR class file during compilation. If the base class for data classes cannot be changed,
        the Observable interface can be implemented using a PropertyChangeRegistry object to register and notify listeners efficiently.
