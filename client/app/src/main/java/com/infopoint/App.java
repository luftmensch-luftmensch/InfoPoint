    All apps using Hilt must contain an Application class annotated with @HiltAndroidApp.
    @HiltAndroidApp kicks off the code generation of the Hilt components and also generates a base class
    for your application that uses those generated components. Because the code generation needs access to all of your modules,
    the target that compiles your Application class also needs to have all of your Dagger modules in its transitive dependencies.
